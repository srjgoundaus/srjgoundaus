## 🎯 About Me

I'm a passionate **Cybersecurity professional** with expertise in **Digital Forensics, Threat Intelligence, and Incident Response (DFIR)**. With a strong commitment to securing digital infrastructures and uncovering cyber threats, I bring hands-on experience in forensic tools and a strategic mindset for cyber defense.

🔍 I work extensively with tools like **Autopsy, FTK, Burp Suite, Wireshark**, and various **OSINT frameworks** to investigate incidents and uncover critical evidence.

### 🔐 Focus Areas:
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)  
- Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering  
- Threat Intelligence & OSINT  
- Network Traffic Analysis  
- Anti-Forensics & Steganography  
- Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessment  

💡 **Currently exploring:** AI-powered security automation and APT hunting.

## 🏆 Key Achievements

- 🧠 Built an **AI-driven malware detection model** that cut false positives by 30%.  
- 🐞 Analyzed and documented **zero-day vulnerabilities** in controlled lab settings.  
- 🔍 Recovered **critical forensic evidence** during real-world investigation simulations.  
- 📚 Developed a **cybersecurity curriculum** empowering beginners to break into the field.
