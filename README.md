## 🎯 About Me

I’m a Cybersecurity Visionary & Forensics Specialist on a mission to defend the digital future. As the founder of NepHack (📺 YouTube & 🌐 nephack.com.au), I’ve built a hands-on learning ecosystem that merges real-world cyber threats with next-gen defensive solutions.

🔐 What I Bring to the Table

Real-World Hacking & Incident Response projects built in offensive and defensive labs

Advanced proficiency in Digital Forensics, Threat Intelligence, and SIEM platforms (Splunk, ELK)

Automation-first mindset: building Python/Bash tools for malware detection, packet analysis, and forensic triage

Documented expertise in Reverse Engineering, Network Traffic Analysis, and Anti-Forensics

### 🔐 Focus Areas:
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)  
- Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering  
- Threat Intelligence & OSINT  
- Network Traffic Analysis  
- Anti-Forensics & Steganography  
- Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessment  

💡 **Currently exploring:** AI-powered security automation and APT hunting.

## 🏆 Key Achievements

- 🧠 Built an **AI-driven malware detection model** that cut false positives by 30%.  
- 🐞 Analyzed and documented **zero-day vulnerabilities** in controlled lab settings.  
- 🔍 Recovered **critical forensic evidence** during real-world investigation simulations.  
- 📚 Developed a **cybersecurity curriculum** empowering beginners to break into the field.
